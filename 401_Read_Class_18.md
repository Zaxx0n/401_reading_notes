# CloudWatch Events 

CloudWatch Events are there so that a user can see a (almost) real-time stream of events to their AWS environments.  The events can trigger notifictation services. It can also be used an a monitoring system, for example an EC2 instance being launched/stopped/termitated. It allows for the use of custom triggers based on events, role or time schedule.


- Events are generated in four ways and are represented by the JSON script. These can be from changes in state or events generated by API calls or console sign-ins.  They can be processed on different levels of AWS.  They can also be scheduled.

- Rules are used to match incoming events and route them to one or more targets or processing. Rules do not have any order for processing, all the rules matching for an event will be processed.

- Targets are process events and are specified within the rules. There are some initial target types.

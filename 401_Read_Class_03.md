# Cyber Risk Analysis

*this is a summary of Infosec's web article titled "CISSP domain 1: Security and risk management — What you need to know for the exam"* 
[Here is a link to that article](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/certification/security-risk-management/)

There are 8 domains covered on the CISSP Certification Exam.  Security and Risk Management is the first of the domains. 

**1. Risk assessment:**
This is when one looks at risks corresponding to identified parameters for a specific period. These risks  must be reevaluated periodically as it is an ongoing process. The following steps are officially part of a risk assessment as per NIST 800-30:

- System characterization
- Threat identification
- Vulnerability identification
- Control analysis
- Likelihood determination
- Impact analysis
- Risk determination
- Control recommendation
- Results documentation

**2. Risk analysis**
Risk can be analyzed by being qualitative and quantitative.

Qualitative analysis is subjective in nature and uses words like “high,” “medium,” “low” to describe the likelihood and severity of the impact of a threat exposing a vulnerability.

Quantitative analysis is objective and numbers-driven. It requires more experience than qualitative analysis and involves calculations to determine a dollar value associated with each risk element. Business decisions are fundamentally driven by this type of analysis. It is essential in order to conduct a cost/benefit analysis

Key pointers to be remembered for risk analysis include:

- AV: Asset value
- EF: Exposure factor
- ARO: Annual rate of occurrence
- Single loss expectancy = AV * EF
- Annual loss expectancy = SLE * ARO
- Risk value = probability * impact (Probability is how likely it is for the threat to materialize and impact the extent of the damage)

**3. Mitigating risk**

There are three acceptable responses to risk mitigation:

- Reduce
- Transfer
- Accept

Organizations need to continue to monitor for risks. How an organization decides to mitigate business risks becomes the basis for security governance and policy.

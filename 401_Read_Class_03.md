# Cyber Risk Analysis

*this is a summary of Infosec's web article titled "CISSP domain 1: Security and risk management — What you need to know for the exam"* 
[Here is a link to that article](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/certification/security-risk-management/)

The article starts off by describing risk management as *"involves comprehensive understanding, analysis and mitigation of risk to help organizations achieve their information security objective."* There will always be security risk and all we can do is make decisions that reduce its likelyhoood. 

I worked really late trying to figure out the Lab tonight with Jon.  I've run out of time and so below is just a copy and paste of what I think would be the most important points of this reading.  By no means to I claim the following words to be of my own.

**1. Risk assessment:**
Looks at risks corresponding to identified parameters for a specific period and must be reevaluated periodically. Managing risks is an ongoing process. The following steps are officially part of a risk assessment as per NIST 800-30:

- System characterization
- Threat identification
- Vulnerability identification
- Control analysis
- Likelihood determination
- Impact analysis
- Risk determination
- Control recommendation
- Results documentation

**2. Risk analysis**
Risk can be analyzed through a qualitative and quantitative lens.

Qualitative analysis is subjective in nature and uses words like “high,” “medium,” “low” to describe the likelihood and severity of the impact of a threat exposing a vulnerability.

Quantitative analysis is objective and numbers-driven. It requires more experience than qualitative analysis and involves calculations to determine a dollar value associated with each risk element. Business decisions are fundamentally driven by this type of analysis. It is essential in order to conduct a cost/benefit analysis

Key pointers to be remembered for risk analysis include:

- AV: Asset value
- EF: Exposure factor
- ARO: Annual rate of occurrence
- Single loss expectancy = AV * EF
- Annual loss expectancy = SLE * ARO
- Risk value = probability * impact (Probability is how likely it is for the threat to materialize and impact the extent of the damage)

**3. Mitigating risk**

There are three acceptable responses to risk mitigation:

- Reduce
- Transfer
- Accept

Organizations need to continue to monitor for risks. How an organization decides to mitigate business risks becomes the basis for security governance and policy.

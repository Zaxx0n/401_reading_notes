SQL stands for standardized query language.  It is a method of inserting, filtering and retrieving information from a database.  It is a full programming language, invented in the 70s.   Attackers exploit flaws in web applications. 

A table is the building block of how data is structured in a database. It is a list of information. 

SQL command words are capitalized and words that change lowercase.

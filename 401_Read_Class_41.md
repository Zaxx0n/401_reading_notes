# Pentesting

A pen test is a simulated cyber attack to check for vulnerabilities. It is often used to augment WAF (web application firewall) and helps fine tune the associated security policies.

**5 Stages of Penetration Testing**
1. Planning and Reconnaissance
- define the scope and goals of a test
- gather intelligence
2. Scanning
- static analysis
- dynamic analysis 
3. Gaining Access
- web application attacks
- exploit vulnerabilities1
4. Maintaining Access
- persistent presence in the exploited system
5. Analysis and WAF Configuration
- results are compiled into a report

There are both external and internal testing. External tests check what assets are visible on the internet. Internal tests are behind the firewall.

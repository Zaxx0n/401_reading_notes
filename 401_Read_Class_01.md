# SOC 
### Systems and Organizations Controls

SOC 2 is applied to many businesses today applying to any service provider that stores customer data in the cloud. Because of this, it is quite relevant to SaaS businesses. SaaS vendors need to be SOC 2 compliant and especially when they sell to the enterprise. 

SOC 2 is a framework that prioritizes the key attributes of security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. However, just completing a SOC 2 certification doesn't make a company 100% secure, but is a good way to gain trust from the customers.

Before SOC 2, the standard for auditing services was known as SAS 70. These were performed by CPAs with the intent to report on the effectiveness of financial controls. In 2010, SOC 1 and SOC 2 were introduced by AICPA.

SOC audits follow the five "Trust Principles" of security, confidentiality, availability, integrity and privacy.

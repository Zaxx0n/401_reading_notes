# Data in Transit vs. Data at Rest

Data in transit is actively moving data.  That could be across a private network, the internet, etc. Data in transit is more vulnerable than data at rest.  When in transit it can be intercepted. 

Data at rest is usually a form of stored data as on a hard drive or other storage device. Considered to be less vulnerable than data in transit, it is still often targeted as it is sometimes considered more valuable by attackers.

To protect data in both states, encryption plays a major role.

Besides encryption, best practices include:
- robust network securtiy controls
- not relying on reactive security, use proactive measures
- carefully choosing data protection solutions (prompts, automatic encryption)
- create policies for systematically categorizing and classifying all company data

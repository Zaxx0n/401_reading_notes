# The Pros & Cons of Intrusion Detection Systems 

Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) can be quite important for an oginization's security. Even though they have many useful applications they come with weaknesses as well. 

The author compares intrusion detection systems to "fire alarms".  In the same way that a fire alarm detects smoke, an IDS will identify potential threats. In this way they can be useful for raising awareness. 

When an IDS detects something it will notify the systemm admin. It monitors traffic by sitting off to the side of a network. It uses sensors to detect suspicous traffic. An IDS can notify security personnel of infections, spyware or key loggers, as well as accidental information leakage, security policy violations, unauthorized clients and servers, and even configuration errors.

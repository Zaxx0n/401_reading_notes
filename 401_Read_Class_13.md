# What is a proxy server?

This is a server that sits in front of a group of client machines.  When the computers try to access Internet services, the proxy server works as a middleman and intercepts the requests and then commiunicates with the web servers on their behalf. 

These services can be used by governments, schools and others to restrict access to the Internet.  At a school, this could be social media.  A government might use this for political reasons. 

It can also be used to protect one's identity. Think VPN. 

## How is a reverse proxy different?
A reverse proxy sits in front of a (or many) web servers and intercepts traffic. The forward proxy sits in front of a client.

I quote, *"The difference between a forward and reverse proxy is subtle but important. A simplified way to sum it up would be to say that a forward proxy sits in front of a client and ensures that no origin server ever communicates directly with that specific client. On the other hand, a reverse proxy sits in front of an origin server and ensures that no client ever communicates directly with that origin server."*

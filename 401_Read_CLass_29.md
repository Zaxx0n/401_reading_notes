# Threat Modeling

A threat model typically includes:

Description of the subject to be modeled
Assumptions that can be checked or challenged in the future as the threat landscape changes
Potential threats to the system
Actions that can be taken to mitigate each threat
A way of validating the model and threats, and verification of success of actions taken

# Threat Hunting

Threat hunting is a proactive activity.  Doing something along the lines of forensics.  You go into a system and see if there are signs of corruption or compromise. Maybe you look for an internal system that has created a channel with a command and control system. A successful threat hunt would be saying with complete certainty that all of the systems look good and that maybe one or two systems will need a deeper dive.


Systems are either protection based or response based. A tie between these two methods is something to work on. Often after a breach of a system, it takes more than 6 months to get the attackers completely off the system. Often the detection is not in house, but through a 3rd party. This means logs are often not working at the level that many companies would hope. An example of a 3rd party being the ones that notify a company would be law enforcement approaching the company and saying that they found their data on a website or elsewhere.

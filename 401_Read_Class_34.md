# Computer Forensics

Forensic computer or cyber experts are key in the battle against cyber threats.  They are incharge of helping increase security in order to assist with safer computer environments.

A computer forensic specialist will investigate security issues, data breaches and other cyber crimes. They work together with other fields, like law enforcement, criminal justice. Experts in this field will recover documents which include photos, emails and other files. A large part of their work often involves "cyber crime". They will work with organizations and help them deal with network breaches.  They will try to determine how the breach happened and then help to prevent such breaches in the future. 

Computer forensics and cybersecurity are quite different. Cybersecurity is focused on prevention while forensics is more focused on being reactionary. A cybersecurity professional works to keep hackers out of systems and someone working in forensics focuses on what to do once a hacker has gotten into a system.

# DLP

DLP is Data Loss Prevention. This is a set of tools that can be used to prevent sensitive data from being lost, misused or accessed by unauthorized users.  It can be used to classify what types of data a company has(regulated, confidential and business critical). It enforces policies such as encryption, remediation via alerts and other protective actions.  It can also prevent file sharing that would put the company at risk.  

DLP prevention is used to solve three main objectives:

1. Personal Information Protection/Compliance (PII, PHI, PCI)
2. IP Protection (Intellectual property)
3. Data Visibility - used to track how individuals at your organization interact with data.

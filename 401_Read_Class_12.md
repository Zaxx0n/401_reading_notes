# Security Operations Center (SOC)

The soc is the hub for an organization's security operations.  It is also called an information security operations center. These centers typically go around the clock.

Security teams consist of analysts and engineers. They watch activity on servers, databases, networks, etc.  They also monitor external sources like threat lists.

SOCs not only identify threats, but analyze, investigate the source and report on the vulnerabilities discovered.  They would then plan how to prevent the same type of events in the future. This is all happening in real time.

There are larger scale SOC called GSOC, the G means Global. These offices span the globe.

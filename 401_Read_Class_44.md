# What is Metasploit

Metasploit is a popular penetration tool that makes hacking a lot easier than in the past. It is used by both red and blue teams. Metasploit is free and comes pre-installed in Kali Linux. It uses only the CLI, but a GUI version is available with a Metasploit Pro license. The first version was released in 2003, written in Perl. It was acquired by Rapid7 in 2009.

It is a penetration testing framework that was assembled to make hacking simple. Point at target-> pick an exploit -> pick payload and hit Enter.

It takes what used to be repetitive labor and automates it. Metasploit integrates with Nmap, SNMP scanning and Windows Patch Enumeration.  There is also a bridge to Nessus.

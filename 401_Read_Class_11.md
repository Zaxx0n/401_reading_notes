# Cybersecurity Automation

These products are widespread.  They can assess systems based on security controls authorized by the user. Once complete, the defects can be remediated.

SOAR is security automation and orchestration and RPA is robotic process automation.  

SOAR products are "purpose-built tools" and perform specific automation activities in response to identified threats.  RPA tools are less specific and allow for a variety of processes to be automated.  RPA are often used in HR and finance. 

Using automation is often vital in order to reliably protect an organization. When using automation, the cybersecurity team can then focus on other activities that are often more complex.(Engineering, Architecture, Remediation, and the likes)
